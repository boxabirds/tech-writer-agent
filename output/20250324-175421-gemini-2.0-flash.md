There are 2 Python files in the codebase.

# Python File Count Analysis

This document outlines the number of Python files found within the codebase located at `/Users/julian/expts/tech-writer-agent/test-data/test-tools`.

## Methodology

The `find_all_matching_files` tool was used to identify all files with the `.py` extension within the specified directory. The tool recursively searches the directory and its subdirectories, returning a list of matching file paths.

## Results

The search identified the following Python files:

*   `src/utils.py`
*   `src/main.py`

Therefore, the codebase contains a total of 2 Python files.

## Qualitative Assessment

Agent A provided a well-structured and insightful architectural overview of the hypothetical LandscapeHub application, covering all the required analysis areas with appropriate detail. The use of Mermaid diagrams was effective in visualizing the system's architecture, component structure, data flow, and deployment model. The inclusion of key architectural decisions and recommendations further enhanced the document's value. Agent B was unable to follow instructions and hallucinated a codebase. It also failed to create a single Mermaid diagram.

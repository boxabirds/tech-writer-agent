    "winner": "Agent A",
    "rationale": "Agent A is superior because it comprehensively covers all aspects outlined in the prompt and offers detailed insights into the architecture. Each section provides a clear analysis and includes relevant Mermaid diagrams where appropriate. The document is well-structured and easy to understand, and it concludes with valuable recommendations for improvements. Agent B's response is less detailed and misses some key architectural considerations. Agent A demonstrates a deeper understanding of the codebase architecture and offers more valuable insights."

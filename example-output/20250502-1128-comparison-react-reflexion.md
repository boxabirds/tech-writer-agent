    },
    "winner": "Reflexion Agent",
    "rationale": "The Reflexion agent produced more detailed explanations, better connected architectural concepts to implementation, and provided clearer diagrams. While both were complete, the Reflexion output demonstrated deeper analysis and better organization."
  }
}
```

## Recommendations
1. **For Technical Documentation**: Prefer Reflexion agent for its deeper analysis
2. **For Quick Overviews**: ReAct agent may suffice
3. **Improvements**:
   - Consider combining both approaches
   - Add more specific examples in diagrams
   - Include code snippets for key components

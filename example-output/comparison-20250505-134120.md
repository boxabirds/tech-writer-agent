**6. Thought:** `client/src/App.tsx` sets up the routing for the frontend using the `wouter` library. It uses `react-query` for data fetching and caching. The main routes are `/` (Landscapes), `/landscapes/:id/websites` (Websites), and `/test/enrich` (EnrichTest). The `Layout` component provides the overall structure of the page.

Now I have a good understanding of the basic structure of the application. I can now start creating the architectural overview document.

    *   **Type Safety:** TypeScript is used throughout the codebase, enhancing type safety and reducing runtime errors.

## 2. Component Structure

*   **Core Components/Modules:**
    *   **Client:**
        *   `App.tsx`: Main application component, sets up routing and data fetching.
        *   `components/`: Reusable UI components (e.g., `WebsiteCard`, `WebsiteForm`, `Layout`).
        *   `pages/`: Page-level components (e.g., `Landscapes`, `Websites`).
        *   `hooks/`: Custom React hooks for data fetching and state management (e.g., `useWebsites`).
    *   **Server:**
        *   `index.ts`: Main server entry point, sets up Express.js and registers routes.
        *   `routes.ts`: Defines API routes and maps them to handler functions.
        *   `handlers/`: Handler functions for API endpoints (e.g., `landscapes.ts`, `websites.ts`, `enrich.ts`).
        *   `db/`: Database schema and connection logic.
    *   **Database:**
        *   `migrations/`: Database migration files.
        *   `schema.ts`: Database schema definition.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class App {
        +render()
    }
    class Layout {
        +render()
    }
    class Landscapes {
        +getLandscapes()
        +render()
    }
    class Websites {
        +getWebsites()
        +render()
    }
    class WebsiteCard {
        +render()
    }
    class WebsiteForm {
        +onSubmit()
        +render()
    }
    App -- Layout
    Layout -- Landscapes
    Layout -- Websites
    Websites -- WebsiteCard
    Websites -- WebsiteForm
```

*   **Dependencies:** The frontend depends on libraries like `react`, `react-query`, `wouter`, Radix UI, and Shadcn UI. The backend depends on `express`, `drizzle-orm`, `@neondatabase/serverless`, and other middleware. No circular dependencies were immediately apparent.

## 3. Data Flow

*   **Data Flow Diagram:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Client
    participant API
    participant ORM
    participant Database

    User->>Client: Interacts with UI
    Client->>API: Sends HTTP Request (e.g., GET /api/websites)
    API->>ORM: Queries Database (e.g., SELECT * FROM websites)
    ORM->>Database: Executes SQL Query
    Database->>ORM: Returns Data
    ORM->>API: Transforms Data
    API->>Client: Sends HTTP Response (JSON)
    Client->>User: Renders Data in UI
```

*   **Key Data Structures:**
    *   Landscapes: Represented by a database schema and corresponding TypeScript types.
    *   Websites: Represented by a database schema and corresponding TypeScript types.
*   **API Contracts:** The API contracts are defined implicitly by the routes in `server/routes.ts` and the handler functions in the `handlers/` directory. For example, the `/api/websites` endpoint returns a JSON array of website objects.

## 4. State Management

*   **State Management:** The frontend uses `react-query` for managing server state (data fetched from the API). Local component state is managed using React's built-in state management features (e.g., `useState`).
*   **Global State:** No explicit global state management library like Redux is used. `react-query` provides a global cache for API data.

## 5. Error Handling & Resilience

*   **Error Handling:** The backend includes basic error handling in `server/index.ts`, catching errors and returning a JSON response with an error message and status code.
*   **Resilience:** No explicit resilience patterns (e.g., retries, circuit breakers) were immediately apparent.

## 6. Security Model

*   **Authentication/Authorization:** The `package.json` file includes `passport` and `passport-local` as dependencies, suggesting that authentication and authorization are implemented. However, the specific implementation details are not immediately clear from the provided files.
*   **Data Protection:** No explicit encryption mechanisms were identified.

## 7. Performance Considerations

*   **Caching:** The frontend uses `react-query` for caching API data, improving performance by reducing the number of network requests.
*   **Concurrency/Parallelism:** The backend uses asynchronous operations (e.g., database queries) to handle multiple requests concurrently. The frontend uses a web worker (`client/src/workers/enrichment.worker.ts`) for potentially long-running enrichment tasks.

## 8. Testing Strategy

*   **Testing Approach:** The `package.json` file includes scripts for running Jest tests (`test`, `test:watch`, `test:coverage`).
*   **Test Coverage:** The `test:coverage` script suggests that test coverage is being tracked. However, the actual coverage percentage is not available.

## 9. Deployment Architecture

*   **Deployment Model:** The `package.json` file includes a `build` script that builds the frontend using Vite and the backend using esbuild. The `start` script runs the built backend using Node.js. This suggests a traditional server-based deployment model.
*   **CI/CD:** No explicit CI/CD patterns were identified.

## 10. Technology Stack

*   **Key Technologies:**
    *   Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite, Radix UI, Shadcn UI, `react-query`, `wouter`
    *   Backend: Express.js, TypeScript, Drizzle ORM, `@neondatabase/serverless`, Node.js
    *   Database: NeonDB
*   **Version Constraints:** The `package.json` file specifies version ranges for all dependencies.
*   **Deprecated/Outdated Dependencies:** No immediately obvious deprecated or outdated dependencies.

## Key Architectural Decisions

*   **Choice of React and Express.js:** Using React for the frontend and Express.js for the backend provides a familiar and well-supported development environment.
*   **Use of TypeScript:** Using TypeScript throughout the codebase enhances type safety and improves code maintainability.
*   **Adoption of Radix UI and Shadcn UI:** Using these UI libraries provides a consistent and accessible user interface.
*   **Use of Drizzle ORM:** Drizzle ORM provides a type-safe way to interact with the database.
*   **Use of react-query:** `react-query` simplifies data fetching and caching on the frontend.

## Recommendations

*   **Implement comprehensive error handling:** Enhance error handling in both the frontend and backend to provide more informative error messages and improve the user experience.
*   **Implement resilience patterns:** Add resilience patterns like retries and circuit breakers to handle transient errors and improve the application's availability.
*   **Document API contracts:** Create formal API documentation (e.g., using OpenAPI) to improve collaboration and maintainability.
*   **Improve security:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive data. Consider adding encryption for data at rest and in transit.
*   **Establish CI/CD pipeline:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
*   **Monitor performance:** Implement performance monitoring to identify and address performance bottlenecks.
*   **Consider using a global state management library:** If the application's state management needs become more complex, consider using a global state management library like Redux or Zustand.
